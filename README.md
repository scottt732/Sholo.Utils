This repository contains miscellaneous utility functions and extension methods.  The packages here are depended upon by other Sholo packages.

## Thanks

A huge thanks to [@RahenSaeedUK](https://twitter.com/RehanSaeedUK) for the [.NET Boxed Templates](https://github.com/Dotnet-Boxed/Templates), without which I probably
would have never gotten around to releasing any of this.

## Related Projects

I've been building a bunch of small utilities, applications, and container related to home automation,
primarily using MQTT and/or [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/).

There are a few foundational libraries/frameworks that I've created along the way.  The table shows the third-party pieces
they're built on.

And a handful of applications that I plan to publish soon.
